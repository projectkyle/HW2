The two majors I picked were Economics (of course) and Business Management and Administration, I picked these because they are both undergraduate degrees offerred
here at the CCNY Colin Powell School. I wanted to compare these two to determine what kind of wages these degreeholders make. One of the main reasons I picked 
Economics over Business Management and Administration was the possibility of earning better wages. According to the dataset, there were 2501 Business Management
and Administration majors and 1574 Economics majors. In count, BMAA majors are 159% of Econ majors. However if you look at the wages, BMAA have an average income of
$63,842 while Econ majors have an average income of $101,423. Econ majors make almost exactly 159% of BMAA's salary! What a coincidence.
